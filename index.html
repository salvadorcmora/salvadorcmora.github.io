    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is Salvador Mora. I am a CS student at Georgia Tech focused on building user-friendly web apps and solid software. I enjoy front-end design, clean code, and shipping features that solve real problems.</p>

    <h2>GT Movies Store</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A movie catalog web app that lets users browse titles, view details, and simulate rent/purchase actions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> This web application first opens up to the homepage, where you'll be able to locate many of the offerings GT Movie Store has.</li>
      <li><strong>Movies:</strong> GT Movies Store has a wide selection of films to choose from. Here, you'll be able to find them all.</li>
      <li><strong>User Creation:</strong> Users are able to create their own accounts to be able to review and purchase films.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> Being a film application, users are able to express their opinions about any film they choose. They can also edit and delete them as they'd like.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> GT Movies is also not just a film review application, as users are also able to purchase Blu-rays of their favorite films.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below is a link to the website. It's completely free! Create an account and try it for yourself!</p>
    <!-- If the app is hosted elsewhere, link it: -->

    <h2>Process Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Most of the ideas written and implemented were taken from the textbook Django 5: For the impatient.</li>
      <li><strong>Design:</strong> The design of the website was to provide easy access to the user.</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Implementing was fairly simple, however many issues did come up in regards to uploading it to the web.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing & Debugging:</strong> Verified every feature and went back through the textbook to assure myself there were no mishaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> Ran the website over and over until I was sure that what I had wrote was good.</li>
    </ul>
